To use ReactProject:
Make sure you have npm installed. 
Copy the contents of ReactProject to your own local directory. Do not do the following inside the Git repo as the modules will not fit.
Navigate to the root directory of the project you have copied and run 'npm install'.
Open the project with 'npm start'.
